# Particles of a Thousand faces

![Particle Simulation Example](./readme/collage.jpg "Particle Simulation")

Welcome to "Particles of a Thousand Faces" - a particle simulation designed to test and experiment with the Three Shading Language. I always found this algorithm to be fast and fun to implement, with plenty of tinkering potiential. It's also quite pleasing to look at.

## Getting Started

To start the development environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ULuIQ12/tsl-particles-of-a-thousand-faces.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd tsl-particles-of-a-thousand-faces
  ```

3. Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

4. Start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser.

## Building the Project

1. Edit the base path in vite.config.ts

2. To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the project in the `dist` directory.


## Features

- **Three.js Integration**: Utilizes the latest three.js library for 3D graphics and animations.
- **TSL and WebGPU**: Takes advantage of Three Shading Language (TSL) and WebGPU for high-performance, real-time graphics rendering.
- **Nodal Approach**: Implements a nodal system for creating complex particle behaviors and effects.
- **Interactive Simulations**: Offers interactive simulations that users can tweak and play with to explore different outcomes.
